# QR Code Reader
This is a single-file QR code reader in Python that takes a matrix of zeroes and ones and decodes the QR code,
purely using the Python Standard Library.
All credit for the implementation goes to [ewino](https://github.com/ewino/qreader); this is just a simplified version of that repo.

## Usage

To use the QR code reader, simply run the `reader.py` script and give the QR code matrix as input.

```python
python reader.py < example.txt
```

The example matrix is from [Problem F](https://codeforces.com/contest/1952/problem/F) from Codeforces April Fool's Day Contest 2024.
